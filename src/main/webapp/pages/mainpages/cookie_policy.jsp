		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data
			files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.</p>
		<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
		<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your
			computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the
			website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login,
			language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of
			time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come
			back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>
		<h3>How do we use cookies?</h3>
		<div class="alert alert-warning" style="text-align: center">
			<p>
				<em>Adjust this part of the page according to your
					needs.&nbsp;Explain which cookies you usein plain, jargon-free
					language. In particular:</em>
			</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
				<li><em>their purpose and the reason why they are being
						used, (e.g. to remember users' actions, to identify the user, for
						online behavioural advertising)</em></li>
				<li><em>if they are essential for the website or a given
						functionality to work or if they aim to enhance the performance of
						the website</em></li>
				<li><em>the types of cookies used (e.g. session or
						permanent, first or third-party)</em></li>
				<li><em>who controls/accesses the cookie-related
						information (website or third party)</em></li>
				<li><em>that the cookie will not be used for any purpose
						other than the one stated</em></li>
				<li><em>how consent can be withdrawn.</em></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Example:</h3>
		<div class="alert alert-info" style="text-align: center">
			<p>A number of our pages use cookies to remember:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
				<li>your display preferences, such as contrast colour settings
					or font size</li>
				<li>if you have already replied to a survey pop-up that asks
					you if the content was helpful or not (so you won't be asked again)</li>
				<li>if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this
					site</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also, some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to
				anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos
				you visited.</p>
			<p>Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the
				website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing
				experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do
				that some features of this site may not work as intended.</p>
			<p>The cookie-related information&nbsp;is not used to identify
				you&nbsp;personally and the pattern data is fully under our control.
				These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those
				described here.</p>

		<h3>How to control cookies</h3>
		<p>
			You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish - for details, see
			<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">aboutcookies.org</a>. You can
			delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set
			most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this,
			however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time
			you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
